# RemoteDMX_ESPNOW
This code aims to control a predefined set of scenes using DMX512 remotely. The remote communication is achieved with ESPNOW.

# Hardware
For the wireless peripheral (which is actually the DMX controller), I have used the Sparkfun ESP32 Thing Plus WROOM: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663
I used it with its DMX feather shield: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15110

For the wireless controller, I used another ESP32 Thing Plus, but that could have been any ESP32 board, since all I needed was ESPNOW.
